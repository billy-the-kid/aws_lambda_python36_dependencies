Given the immense pain of finding/installing/playing with the dependencies required to use common python modules, I've uploaded some files here I hope I all find useful.

PYMYSQL - this is ready to use. Can be uploaded as a layer to lambda. To use with your source code, extract everything out of the 'python' directory. 

Matplotlib - given the size requirements, this is broken down into two files, matplotlib_pkg and matplotlib. Simply download both, extract the contents of matplotlib, and add the files and directories into the 'python' directory in the matplotlib_pkg zip to use as a layer. Same as above, if you wish to have your source code with the dependencies in a single zip, everything put be pulled out of the 'python' directory.
