Given the immense pain of finding/installing/playing with the dependencies required to use common python modules, I've uploaded some files here I hope I all find useful.

PYMYSQL - this is ready to use. Can be uploaded as a layer or with your source code to lambda.

Matplotlib - given the size requirements, this is broken down into two files, matplotlib_pkg and matplotlib. Simply download both, extract the contents of matplotlib, and add the files and directories into the 'python' directory in the matplotlib_pkg zip. Upload as a layer or use with your source code.
